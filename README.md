# calculator
The Odin Project calculator

WARNING: EXTREMLY SMELLY CODE

A Basic calculator with memory function.

To use memory function, hit the M1, M2 or M3 key to select a location and hit STORE. You can only store after an operation.  An arrow will show that you have a value stored 
in that position. To recall that number, hit the memory key again and hit RECALL. To Clear a memory positoin, it CLR MEM and select the position to erase.

Known Issues:
- Switching between opreators is wonky and only works reliably on occasion, meaning if you hit subtract and then plus, it might mess up. I will fix it someday.
- The history at the top is only accurate after an operation has been made (The total updates dynamically, but the operand does not show until hitting equal)
